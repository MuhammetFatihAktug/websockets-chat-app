# Chat Application with using Websockets in Spring Boot

I followed a tutorial on YouTube to build this chat application. You can watch the tutorial for detailed instructions on how to create a similar application:

- [Github](https://github.com/ali-bouali/spring-boot-websocket-chat-app) by [Bouali Ali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TywlS9iAZCM&t=3134s)

## Used Technologies

During the development of this application, I utilized the following technologies:

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): A powerful Java framework for building web applications.
- [WebSocket](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/): A communication protocol for real-time, full-duplex communication between a client and a server.
- [STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)](https://stomp.github.io/): A messaging protocol that defines the format and rules for data exchange.
- [SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client): A JavaScript library that provides a WebSocket-like object in browsers that don't support WebSocket.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to start the application:

```maven
mvn spring-boot:run
```
